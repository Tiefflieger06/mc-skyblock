# Skyblock Dimension by Tiefflieger06
Github Repository for my custom Skyblock Dimension Minecraft datapack


This is one of the first datapacks that I coded myself, so if you encounter any bugs or want to suggest new features/changes, let me know in the comments below or contact me.

## Features:
This datapack creates a fourth minecraft dimension which is the so-called skyblock dimension. It can be entered using „/trigger skyblock“. This allows you to add a skyblock gamemode to your already existing minecraft server/world, and players can easily switch between the vanilla survival world and the skyblock dimension and play entirely different gamemodes, all while being on the same server.

The skyblock experience itself is also slightly different from the vanilla skyblock experience, as I added several new crafting recipes and loot tables with the goal of making some time consuming tasks easier (like waiting for a wandering trader) and also making every item available in skyblock that would normally be available in vanilla survival.

## Supported game versions:
Due to huge changes to datapacks in version 1.20.5+, this datapack officially supports only the following versions:
– 1.20.1, 1.20.4

Untested versions (Please report any errors that may occur here)
– 1.20 and 1.20.2 (use 1.20.1 version)
